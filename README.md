For many of us, Excel was the one to open up the world of data. Let us not forget its functionalities and usefulness in the face of many fancier softwares. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π  

Here, you can find some projects developed solely with Excel and Power Query.  

‚Ä¢ üí° [Production Optimization Modeling](https://github.com/isabelabpas/excel_projects/tree/main/Excel%20Optimization%20Project): In this project, I utilized Excel to optimize the production and marketing strategy for Hawley Lighting Company‚Äôs diverse range of lighting products, including table, floor, ceiling, and pendant lamps. Using linear programming and optimization modeling, I created an efficient production schedule and resource allocation strategy that balanced costs, production efficiency, and market response. Sensitivity analysis provided actionable insights into advertising budgets, production outsourcing, and strategic improvements, offering the company a clear path to maximize profitability while maintaining cost-effectiveness.  
  
‚Ä¢ üßÉ [Beverage Sales Dashboarding](https://github.com/isabelabpas/excel_projects/tree/f26c014338d8cb149177e45f87f3af3da3ddaccc/Beverage%20Sales%20Project): This project involved creating an interactive dashboard in Excel to analyze beverage sales data. The data was first prepared using Tableau Prep, where data transformation techniques were applied, including creating calculated columns, performing table joins, and executing unions to consolidate the dataset. The transformed data was then imported into Excel, where pivot tables and pivot charts were designed for analysis. Using VBA, the dashboard was programmed for dynamic updates, enabling charts and tables to refresh automatically when new data was added. The final dashboard presents a simple interface for exploring sales trends.
